## Getting Started

To build the project in the local working directory after the project has been cloned/forked, run:

```mvn clean install```

from the command line interface.

### Prerequisites

1. Maven
2. Java 17

### Installation

[How to set up maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)

[Install Java](https://adoptium.net/installation/)

### Running the tests

```mvn test```

### Deployment

`utils` project serves as a library for the services. It is not meant to be deployed as a service in any cloud environment.

## Usage
Add the following dependency in the target project
```
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.eclipse.ecsp</groupId>
  <artifactId>utils</artifactId>
  <version>1.X.X</version>
</dependency>
```

### Logging

To implement logging in the services, the services need to get an instance of `IgniteLogger` class using the `IgniteLoggerFactory` factory class.

Example:
```java
private static IgniteLogger logger = IgniteLoggerFactory.getLogger(ProtocolTranslatorPreProcessor.class);
```

The `IgniteLogger` is an extension of slf4j logger. All the concepts related to logging an error message, exception, stack traces, etc. alongwith the different log levels remain the same.

### Health Check

`utils` provides the services with Health Check capabilities by implementing a number of different `HealthMonitor` instances. 
`HealthService` listens to the health state changes in all the `HealthMonitor` instances implemented by the service and maintains Gauge data for the healthy and unhealthy health monitors along with the overall health of the service for service health monitoring.


### Diagnostic Reporting

`utils` provides the service with Diagnostic reporting capabilities by implementing a number of `DiagnosticReporter` instances which in turn maintain `DiagnosticData` for the metrics and the corresponding `DiagnosticResult`.
`DiagnosticService` listens to all the enabled diagnostic reporters and do the reporting in Graylog besides publishing the metrics in prometheus about diagnostic data of a service.

### Implementing metrics
`utils` provides the service with metrics - Counters, Gauge and Histogram.
Any service can extend the above metrics for reporting and monitoring purpose.

Examples:

<b> Implementing a Counter </b>

Custom `Counter` classes need to extend the abstract class `AbstractIgniteCounter`

```java
public class GenericIgniteCounter extends AbstractIgniteCounter {
    public GenericIgniteCounter(String name, String help, String... labels) {
        createCounter(name, help, labels);
    }    
}
```

<b> Implementing a Gauge </b>

Custom `Gauge` classes need to extend the abstract class `AbstractIgniteGauge`

```java
public class IgniteDiagnosticGuage extends IgniteGuage {
    public IgniteDiagnosticGuage() {
        createGuage("diagnostic_metric", "node", "diagnostic_reporter_name", "diagnostic_reporter_sublabel");
    }
}
```

<b> Implementing a Histogram </b>

Custom `Histogram` classes need to extend the abstract class `AbstractIgniteHistogram`

```java
public class GenericIgniteHistogram extends AbstractIgniteHistogram {
    public GenericIgniteHistogram(String name, String help, double[] buckets, String... labelNames) {
        createHistogram(name, help, buckets, labelNames);
    }
}
```
